Data Structures:

Part of Coding Nomads bootcamp was to code data structures from scratch.

I implemented:

a) Queue from Python list

b) Stack from Python list

c) Queue from 2 of my implementations of Stack

Move items from enqueue stack to dequeue stack and vice versa

d) Linked List from scratch

e) Dictionary using Python list and my implementation of Linked List

The dictionary has a list with a Linked List at each position if necessary. 
A key value pair is added to the list by hashing the key.
A linked list is used at each position in the list.
If any linked list reaches a length of 5 then the list size is doubled and rehashed.
